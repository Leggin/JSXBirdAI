    <h1 id="jsxbirdai">JSXBirdAI</h1>

    <p>JSXBirdAI is a flappy bird ai implemented in the <a
            href="https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html">JSXGraph library</a>. The ai optimizes how to play
        flappy bird with unsupervised learning, which is implemented as evolutionary algorithm.</p>

    <h2><a id="How_the_AI_works_21"></a>How the AI works</h2>
    <p>Every ball is an independent neural net of size (5,4,1), which means it has an input layer of 5 nodes, one hidden
        layer of 4 nodes and an ouput layer of 1 node.</p>
    <h4><a id="Input_layer_25"></a>Input layer</h4>
    <p>The 5 input nodes are what each ball “sees”:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Input index</th>
                <th>Input value</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>the y coordinate of the ball</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>the x coordinate of the closest obstacle</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>the y coordinate of the top border of the closest obstacle</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>the y coordinate of the bottom border of the closest obstacle</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>the current velocity of the ball</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3><a id="Output_layer_41"></a>Output layer</h3>
    <p>The output layer consists of one node with sigmoid as activation function. Which means, that the output is either
        1 or 0.</p>
    <p>If the output is 1, the ball will perform a jump (which is the equivalent of tapping when playing the game
        yourself). If the output is 0, nothing will happen.</p>
    <h3><a id="Functionality_49"></a>Functionality</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of the animation 600 balls are generated. Each ball has its own neural net. At each animation
        step, each ball performs a prediction with the given inputs from above. The output of this prediction is then
        performed on each ball. For each pixel that a ball has progressed through the obstacle course in x-direction, it
        receives a point. If a ball touches an obstacle, it is removed from the animation, but held in an list of “dead”
        balls. When there is no ball left, a new generation is created in which 3% of the best scoring balls are
        remixed. Then the remaining 97% are “rebreeded”, this means that their “genes” (which is the weights of the net)
        are crossed with genes of a different ball. This results in a completely new neural net. Then every ball is
        mutated with a chance of 8%. The mutation is that each weight in the neural net is multiplied by a random value
        between -1 and 1 as well as each bias. This results in a different neural network, which in turn performs the
        obstacle course differently than before.</p>
    <p><em>The hope is that after a few generations, randomness will result in a neural network that will carry out the
            obstacle course without crashing.</em></p>
